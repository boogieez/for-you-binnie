      <h1>can i be your lover again?</h1>
      <p>hi bin, i want to tell you that i'm sorry for everything. i hurt you a lot and i realize my mistakes. i waited for a long time to ask you again. i wasnt the best bf out there but ive loved you from the bottom of my heart for a while now. i'm sorry i couldn't give out my love in your language. i will try my hardest this time to not only tell with words but show you with my actions. i'll learn the language you love in. i dont know if reading this is making you hate me, i really do hope not. give me another chance at being your love. (｡•́︿•̀｡) ⋆｡° ✮ </p>
